# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network ✍️🔢🧠

This repository contains code and resources for performing handwritten digit recognition using a neural network. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Dataset 📊🖼️

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images representing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, allowing us to train the neural network on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen samples.

## Approach 📝🔬

The handwritten digit recognition model is built using a neural network architecture. The input images are flattened into a vector and fed into the network, which consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. Training is performed using optimization techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases of the network. The model learns to recognize patterns and features in the images, enabling it to make accurate predictions on new unseen digit images.

## Contents 📁🔍

The repository includes the following files:

- `preprocessing.py`: Code for preprocessing and preparing the MNIST dataset for training.
- `train.py`: Code for training the neural network model using the preprocessed dataset.
- `predict.py`: Code for predicting handwritten digits using the trained model.
- `evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset and generating metrics such as accuracy and loss.

## Usage 💻🚀

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Preprocess the MNIST dataset
3. Train the neural network model 
4. Use `predict.py` to classify handwritten digits using the trained model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and analyze results
